<p>
  Imagine you want to go on a vacation to a place that doesn't have a direct connection to your
  departure location. Planning out a route to your destination and keeping track of everything can
  be difficult. This is where virtual interlining comes into place. Virtual Interlining makes
  planes, trains, buses, ferries and taxis connect, even when the operators donâ€™t work together, and
  protects customers from missed connections, delays or schedule changes.

  's B2B platform for partners of all sizes that enables business to start selling Virtually Interlined
  flights, buses and trains from Kiwis inventory almost immediately and benefit from all the tools in
  one place including a robust account management system with multiple roles, API's, analytics, payments,
  etc.

<h2 looksLike="h3">My Role</h2>

As a <highlight>Frontend developer</highlight> this was my first big long-term project, it was and still is a joy <highlight>writing optimized,
maintainable code.</highlight> Since I've joined the team, we moved from a "move fast, break things" type monolith
into a highly optimized React hooks driven project. We've <highlight>massively improved UX</highlight> and redefined or introduced
several features. The project features <highlight>tons of APIs</highlight> that needed to be integrated and one of the more
exciting things was moving away from Redux to React Context as Tequila is mostly a static page and optimizing
loading even further. I also improved our CI/CD flow on Gitlab by 50%.

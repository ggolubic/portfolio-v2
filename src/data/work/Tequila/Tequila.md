<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Imagine you want to go on a vacation to a place that doesn't have a direct connection to your departure location. Planning out a route to your destination and keeping track of everything can be difficult. This is where virtual interlining comes into place. 
Virtual Interlining makes planes, trains, buses, ferries and taxis connect, even when the operators donâ€™t work together, and protects customers from missed connections, delays or schedule changes.

<h2>The Project</h2>
Tequila is <a href="kiwi.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kiwi.com</a>'s B2B platform for partners of all sizes that enables business to start selling Virtually Interlined flights, buses and trains from Kiwis inventory almost immediately and benefit from all the tools in one place including a robust account management system with multiple roles, API's, analytics, payments, etc.

<h2>My Role</h2>
As a Frontend developer this was my first big long-term project, it was and still is a joy writing optimized, maintainable code. Since I've joined the team, we moved from a "move fast, break things" type monolith into a highly optimized React hooks driven project. We've massively improved UX and redefined or introduced several features. 
The project features tons of APIs that needed to be integrated and one of the more exciting things was moving away from Redux to React Context as Tequila is mostly a static page and optimizing loading even further.

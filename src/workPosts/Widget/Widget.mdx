  Widget is a platform that uses Kiwi's own affiliate system and is targeted mostly at travel blogs,
  airports or similar websites but basically anyone can embed it via an iframe. It has numerous
  customization options to fit any site and offers tracking. To get a widget for your site, you have
  to register on{' '}

<h2 looksLike="h3">My Role</h2>

As a <highlight>Frontend developer</highlight> I worked closely on designing the architecture and building the UI for Widget.
Widget is based on a <highlight>GraphQL API </highlight> implemented via Apollo. I took part in building the <highlight>localization system and implementing an in-house tracking system</highlight>.
The biggest challenge was to make a scalable iframe that scales with content using post messages.
